// create a function that does subtraction

// create a function that does multiplication

// create a function that does division

// create three variable two operands and a operator

// create a function operate thate takes the two operands and a operator and calls one of the math functions

// create functions that populate the display when you click the buttons on the calculator and store that value in a variable

// store both number inputs and call the operate function when the user hits the = button

// update the display with the result of the operation when the = sign is pressed

// evaluate one pair of numbers at a time and update the first variable with the result along with then allowing only a next operator

// round answers with long decimals to prevent overflow

// don't allow the = button to work prematurally

// make sure there is a clear button that wipes out all data

// display a error message if the user tries to divide by 0

// prevent a operator from being used twice in a row
